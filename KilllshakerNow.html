Go to YouTube and log in with your Google account. Once you are logged in, you will see your name or username at the top of the left menu. Click this to access your user page.
	</p>
	<P>
Add a profile picture. It's a necessary piece of your YouTube channel. Make sure it has something to do with your channel name to ensure it's not confused with someone else's that looks similar.

Add channel art. This is an image that is seen at the top of your channel page. YouTube will show examples of how the image will be displayed from the website, on a TV, and on a mobile device.
Use artwork that will draw your viewer’s attention. The cover image will set your channel apart from the rest of the YouTube interface.
Include your channel’s name or a message in the channel art. This will help solidify your name in the viewer’s mind.
YouTube recommend your channel art file should be 2560 x 1440 pixels
Change your channel art regularly. Unless you want to set a brand image by keeping the same picture, consider regularly changing your channel art about what content you are releasing in your channel. For example, if you are doing comedy sketches, change the channel art so that it relates to your current set of sketches.

	<p>
		Describe your channel. Add a brief description for your channel to let the viewer know what kind of content to expect. To adjust the channel description, click the About tab in the main channel window. From there click the “+ Channel description” button.
Use the description to include links to your other websites, or to update news about your channel. Discuss who appears in your videos and link other related channels.
Make sure your description makes sense, because it is publicly visible at all times. It should most likely be a brief description of you and your channel.
	</p>
	<p>
		Name your channel. Look at your description and the intended video content. Use this to determine the name.
For example: if your videos are about knitting beautiful hats, you could call it: Proudly Knitted; The Infinite Knitter; or Woolly Mountains. And so forth.
